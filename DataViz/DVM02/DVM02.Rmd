# Introduction

For DataViz Makeover 02, the goal is to reveal inter- and intra-zonal public bus flows at the planning subzone level.

We will be using data for the Origin-Destination records of all Bus Trips in Singapore for January 2022. The base dataset for this was obtained from [LTA Data Mall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html)  and combined with planning area and subzone information via GIS Overlay operation.

Mapping data used was the [URA Master Plan 2014 Planning Subzone Boundary Map](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/master-plan-2014-subzone-boundary-web) obtained from data.gov.sg.

# Critique

The visualization prepared by [Prof Kam](https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/kam-tin-seong-486) for the critique part of this makeover is shown as below. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%', results = 'markup'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/crit1.jpg")  
```

## Clarity Critiques

__No Title and Subtitle__

The visualization as a whole had no title or subtitle, there were only titles for each individual graph. Readers do not know what they are supposed to understand from the entire visualization even if they know what each graph is showing. 

Recommendation: A title is a mandatory requirement for visualization since it would give the users an idea of what they are looking at so that they can better understand the entire visualization.

__No information regarding the data__

In most cases, the visualization would at least contain a brief introduction on what the overall data set used was, when and where it came from, but there was no such introduction in this visualization. Reader would thus be unsure of what information they are inferring since they are not able to have a proper grasp on where and and when this data was collected and represents.

Recommendation: Information regarding the dataset such as the dates they represent or where the data was collected should be included in either the title or subtitle.

__Incorrect Labeling (Bar Graph X-Axis)__

The label reads ‘time per hour’ and a reader’s first assumption would be that the x-axis shows the amount of time per hour is recorded/spent etc that the graph is trying to represent. Then when they look back at the title of the graph, “Trips attracted to XX“ and they will get confused since the title is implying that the graph should show number of trips to/from a station but the axis label is instead showing time per hour which doesn’t make sense.

Recommendation: Change labeling for X-axis to Time of Day for clearer communication of the 24 hours in a day.

__Over-compressed Adjacency Matrix__

Because of the amount of space available for the visualization is limited, the adjacency matrix has been compressed to the point where no usable information can be gained from it unless the cursor is hovered over a node to trigger the tooltip. To a reader, this matrix just looks extremely confusing since all the rows and columns are so cramped that it is difficult to even find the right node to hover over. This is made worse by the fact that the axis are so compact that there is no way to visually differentiate an individual "Row" or "Column" at all.

Recommendation: either reduce the number of rows and columns or use an alternate visualization method for this purpose. Given the importance of each sub zone to the entire visualization, the latter is more recommended.

__Difficult to compare bar chart results__

The Bar charts seem to be trying to show a comparison between the frequency of weekday trips against weekend trips for both origin and destination subzones, however it is difficult to do an exact comparison because the graphs are separated. Thus, readers will need to read back and forth on each point in order to get a more accurate reading of the differences which is tedious.

Recommendation: Combine the bar charts for weekday and weekend / holiday into 1 for easier comparisons

## Asthetics Critiques

__Single Color Bar Charts__

All of the bar charts are colored in the same shade of blue which make it harder to for users to differentiate between them. Having a different colors for different groups like Weekday vs Weekend would make it much easier to compare given that users will not be constantly looking at the same colors.

Recommendations: Use different colors for Weekday and Weekend / Holiday


__Unusable Adjacency Matrix__

As mentioned previously, the matrices are so compact that it is very difficult to extract information from them. Worse, because of their compactness, they are extremely displeasing to look at, especially the markings for the rows and columns.

Firstly, the columns for both matrices are so cramped that they resemble a black bar more than a row of words.

Secondly, the rows for weekend matrix is totally missing which might be a result of that matrix being compressed more than it's partner because of the need to meet the height of the weekend bar charts.

The rows for the weekday matrix are not much better, resembling a hodgepodge of words jumbled together.

Recommendation: Change the visualization method or give the matrices enough space to breathe and fit everything properly

__Filter column too exposed and long__

The filter column display method was multiple value selection list for both weekday and weekend that would change the bar chart. Due to the number of sub zones in Singapore, there was no way to squeeze all of them into one column space which resulted in the two filters having to be scrolled down to access all of the sub zone. This not only took up valuable space that could have been put to better use but also looks very ugly.

Recommendation: Use a drop-down list instead so as to hide all the options away. Additionally, using float would allow the list to be placed in the empty space around the bar charts.



# Proposed Design

Based on the recommendation for the critiques above, I propose the following design.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%', results = 'markup'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/propose.jpg")  
```

## Heat Maps of Singapore

This is a replacement to the adjacency matrices of the original visualization. 

Using the sub zone planning data, we are able to create maps of Singapore split by subzone which will allow readers to see the relative positions of the each sub zone more easily.

The idea is to use 2 maps of Singapore, the first will show the number of trips originating from each sub zone and the second will show the number of trips ending in each sub zone. 2 maps are used instead of 1 because putting both start and end into 1 map would make it extremely difficult to read and impossible to compare. 

The heat map will differentiate by color, where the darker the color will mean the greater the number of trip to/from that sub zone

With 2 maps, we will also be able to do filtering based on sub zone selection in either maps. This way, readers will be able to observe the how strongly the various sub zone are connected via trips. For example, selecting "Kovan" in the origin heat map will result in the destination heat map filtering for sub zones that have trips starting from Kovan, thus readers can see which are the common destinations for bus trips from Kovan. The same works for the reverse where selecting a sub zone in the destination heat map will filter for sub zones with trips that end in the selected one.



Additionally, the maps will have a popup tooltip that shows the top 3 trip origins or destinations (depending on which map) for that sub zone as well as the number of trips to and from that sub zone that will depend on whether the filter is used or not.

## Bar Charts

Next to each heat map are the bar charts that represent the frequency of trips to and from the sub zones. The charts are an improvement to the original ones where the weekday and weekend charts are combined together with a weekday+weekend bar chart to form the final result. It allows for readers to make comparison for all 3 categories of Days much easier compared to before.
Additionally, the chart is also affected by the filter from the heat maps. 

__Proposed Filter Results__

No filter: Shows frequency distribution for the all sub zones

Selecting a Sub Zone in the Origin Heat Map (eg Kovan): 
The Origin Bar chart shows the frequency of trips from Kovan to all locations
The Ending Bar Chart shows the frequency of trip from Kovan that end in Kovan

Selecting a Sub Zone in the Destination Heat Map (eg Hougang):
The Origin Bar Chart shows the frequency of trips from Hougang that end in Hougang.
The Ending Bar chart shows the frequency of trips from all locations that end in Hougang

# Final Visualization

After completing the steps above, it will result in the following visualization.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%', results = 'markup'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/final.jpg")  
```

# Insights

## Regional Flow Hubs

Looking at the heat map in it's whole form with no filters, it is immediately clear that there are 3 clusters which have high frequency of trips beginning and ending there.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%', results = 'markup'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/insight1.jpg")  
```

In the east, the cluster surrounds Tampiness and Bedok. In the North, the cluster is around Yishun and Woodlands and in the West the cluster is around Jurong West. These areas have been known as residential areas for several decades and the heatmaps supports this since residential areas would get more traffic as people travel to and from work everyday. 

## More Trips occuring in East Singapore

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%', results = 'markup'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/insight2.jpg")  
```

From the heatmaps, we can also tell that there is much more flow of trips within the eastern region compared to the west as the Eastern sub zones are colored much darkner compared to the western sub zones. This is possibly due to a larger population in the East compared to West, especially in recent decades when the North-East areas like Hougang, Punggol started becoming more developed and more families moved in.

## Travel flow is highest to and from surrounding sub zones

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%', results = 'markup'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/insight3.jpg")  
```

The figure above shows the origin of trips that end in Tampines East, the sub zone with highest origin and destinations in Singapore. It is clear that the surrounding sub zones contribute the most trips to Tampines, but hovering over other sub zones further our shows that there are still some trips from the North, South and Central Singapore to Tampines East. As expected the West had the fewest trips to Tampines East, given that a bus journey there is easily well over an hour in duration.

The same result can be seen from most parts of Singapore except for certain sub zones in the South.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%', results = 'markup'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/insight4.jpg")  
```

The figure above shows the destination sub zones of trips from Dhoby Ghaut which is a central location next to Plaza Singapore within the main entertainment district of Singapore. While msot trips originating there still end around the same region, we can see that there are a greater spread of destinations compared to the previous figure of Tampiness East.

This suggest that for residential sub zones, most of the bus trips are within the same region as people go to and from work or school nearby. Comparatively, because the south is where the CBD and shopping districts are, the spread of trip flow destination/origin is larger due to people from around Singapore heading there for either work or enjoyment.

## Peaks in Travel Flow more Pronounced in Weekdays compared to Weekends / Holidays

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%', results = 'markup'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/insight5.jpg")  
```

The figure above is the Frequency Bar charts for the entire Singapore with no filter. We can see that overall, the trips made on weekdays far exceeds weekends which is expected as 1) there are more weekdays and 2) people travel for work on weekdays and less travel on the weekends.

However, we can see that there the trip frequency by hours is more even compared to the weekdays which has 2 pronounced peak periods, between 7 - 9 am and 5-7pm. These peaks can be attributed to the start and end of the work day for most workers which is when large numbers of people are travelling to and from work resulting in such a pronounced difference in frequency compared to the other timings.

The reason why weekends / holidays do not have pronounced peaks and instead a gentle curved peaking around the afternoon is because people dont have to go to work in the morning and can rest at home before going out in the later part of the day.
